# Aurex
Platform is a web-based crypto dashboard built for both new users and experienced traders. It’s an online platform that makes managing crypto clear, fast, and visually clean. Designed and developed as a front-end–focused web project, Aurex puts emphasis on clarity, trust, and smooth interaction.

## What it does?
- Easy crypto trading: Buy, sell, and track assets without confusing screens.
- Clean portfolio view: See balances, price changes, and trends at a glance.
- Fast performance: Lightweight front end that loads quickly and feels responsive.
- Modern visuals: Perfect gradients, soft shadows, and dark UI create a premium crypto feel.

## Build timeline
- Front-End Development: Built as a modern web interface with structured layout and responsive design.
- Vibe Coding with Aura.ai: Aura.ai was used to speed up layout building, visual decisions, and component flow, keeping development efficient and focused.
- Visual-First Approach: Strong attention to gradients, shadows, spacing, and typography to match high-end crypto platforms like crypto.com.

Most crypto platforms are either overwhelming or visually outdated. Aurex sits in the middle: clean, modern, and easy to understand without feeling basic. It’s designed to help users focus on their assets, not fight the interface. Whether checking prices, managing a portfolio, or getting started with crypto, Aurex keeps everything simple and visually polished.
